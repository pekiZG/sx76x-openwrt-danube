version 1.0.13, 2005-08-01
----------------------------
CHG Updated embedded controller download to V3.13.05 for VINETIC® -4M/C 
    Version 2.2 and V4.04.12 for VINETIC® -S Version 2.1

version 1.0.12, 2005-07-29
----------------------------
FIX Event report for RFC2833 event packets from network did not work correctly.

version 1.0.11, 2005-07-27
----------------------------
CHG PHONE_DTMF_OOB now makes no check on the used coder
CHG The driver supports to differentiate the between interrupt line and global
	interrupts. If the driver is not set to polling mode and no interrupt line
	is configured, the global interrupt is locked instead. Interrupts are
	unlocked when the critical software part is done.
CHG Change the parameter of the structure 'TAPI_PHONE_AGC' to lower-case.
FIX DTMF event were not reported for TAPI channel 5 and 6 of one VINETIC device.
FIX The TAPI event 'TAPI_SIGNAL_CIDENDTX' was reported to early for FSK
	transmission mode. Now the event is reported when the CID transmission is
	completed for DTMF and FSK.

version 1.0.10, 2005-07-15
----------------------------
CHG Compile for VINETIC S improved
FIX Test access defines missing

version 1.0.9, 2005-07-14
----------------------------
CHG Remove T.38 signal detection code, which leads to problems
FIX No ALM LEC configuration in case of any VINETIC S
FIX Inconsistent Jitter buffer setting fixed between init and call to
    IFXPHONE_JB_CONF.  Bits PJE and DVF were reset.
FIX While handling IFXPHONE_INIT, tapi driver configures CID transmitter to
    send CID to both Adder-1 and Adder-2 (SIGNL_baseConf). It is now by default
    configured to be sent to ALM only.
CHG CPT detection implemention changed to new tone api.
FIX Inconsitency of signal connection on multiple tapi initializations fixed

version 1.0.8, 2005-07-01
----------------------------
NEW Add the 'TAPI_PHONE_STATUS.signal' event 'TAPI_SIGNAL_CIDENDTX' to
    indicate that the Caller-ID is transmitted successfully. For DTMF, the
    event is generated when the transmission is complete. For FSK, the event
    is generated when the last bytes are written to the VINETIC.
    Note: Here the end of transmission comes delayed after the event occurs.
NEW Add the 'TAPI_PHONE_STATUS.line' event 'TAPI_LINESTATUS_RINGFINISHED' to
    indicate that the initial ringing hat ended. This event is used in order
    to synchronize the CID1 scenario on application level.
NEW Add the 'TAPI_PHONE_STATUS.error' flag to signalize runtime errors to host.
    Error events are defined in TAPI_ERROR enumeration.
FIX Add a workaround with new driver API in order to change the different line
    modes. The VINETIC 2.1 does not recognize the automodes correctly.
    The linemodes 'TAPI_LINEFEED_NORMAL_LOW' and 'TAPI_LINEFEED_REVERSED_LOW'
    are added to change to short line manually.
    The new event 'TAPI_LINESTATUS_FEEDLOWBATT' indicates that the change to
    low feeding has to be done manually.
FIX CID Appearance check is done accordingly in the scenario
    <initial ringing> <periodical ringing with cid tx>
FIX Runtime error TAPI_ERROR_RINGCADENCE_CIDTX is set in TAPI_PHONE_STATUS.error
    and asserted in case the ring pause time is not enough.

version 1.0.7, 2005-06-30
----------------------------
CHG Linetesting improvements for SLIC LCP merged from 0.11 project

version 1.0.6, 2005-06-23
----------------------------
CHG IFXPHONE_REC_START/IFXPHONE_REC_STOP only enables/disables the encoder. The
    decoder is enabled/disabled by IFXPHONE_PLAY_START/IFXPHONE_PLAY_STOP
CHG Old stuff for Hook recognition and Pulse dialing removed.
FIX new module connection implementation now also supports local and external
    conferencing
CHG PHONE_VAD now does not return an error if activated with G.729E.
FIX in PHONE_VAD: Always apply the VAD setting not matter which coder is used
FIX Wake up application on blocking ring after off hook. Previously the
    application had to wait till the max rings has expired no matter if off
    hook appeared or not.
FIX Requesting the RTCP statistics of the device by usind
    'TAPI_LL_Phone_RTCP_PrepareStatistics' and
    'TAPI_LL_Phone_RTCP_GatherStatistics' in the interrupt context fixed.
    Driver wrote to long message to the mailbox in order to request an update.
CHG The PHI programs for 8 bit and for V1.3 are now internally selected by
    the driver according to the configured access mode
CHG DTMF Generator was configured that tones will be generated in transmit
    and receive direction after a DTMF event occures. Tones are now only
    generated in recieve direction (adder-2, to the subscriber)
CHG On the IFXPHONE_RTCP_STATISTICS command the field ssrc gets now the value
    which was configured previously by IFXPHONE_RTP_CONF (stored in driver)
CHG Dail and Packet FIFO allocation and freeing modified
CHG IFXPHONE_TONE_TABLE_CONF now applies to the driver no longer to devices
    (global table)
CHG Play on UTG and TG at the same time now possible. Minimal resource
    management implemented. The tone play and stop service must specify
    which resource to be used: TAPI_TONE_SRC_TG or TAPI_TONE_SRC_DSP.
    Default uses DSP on VIP/M/C and TG on S.
FIX When invalid chip information received, the driver returned no error
    on init.
FIX TAPI_NONE as mode for IFXPHONE_INIT does not call Basic_xConf()
CHG RUNTIME_TRACE available without EVALUATION
FIX IrqPollMode is initialized/reset correctly if no IRQ is configured
NEW Added IFXPHONE_TONE_PLAY_NET for data fds. The playout of tones
    simultaneously on different sources (TG and UTG) is not supported.
    Also the playout of local and network tones at the same time is not
    supported. Composed tones are not supported for source TG.
FIX add parameter check for IFXPHONE_x_ADD / IFXPHONE_x_REMOVE
FIX in the driver feature IFXPHONE_SET_PCM_CONFIG / IFXPHONE_SET_PCM_ACTIVATION
    (Deactivation and higher Timeslots were not working properly)
NEW Added LEC resource management to the driver. It shares the available LEC
    resources between the ALM-Modules and the PCM-Modules.
    The resource management is used by the driver feature
    IFXPHONE_LECCONF / IFXPHONE_LECCONF_PCM

version 1.0.5.0, 2005-05-03
----------------------------
FIX TAPI_LINEFEED_PARKED is now power down VBATH mode (was sleep power down)

version 1.0.4.0, 2005-05-02
----------------------------
NEW Tone-API with modulation and cadence steps on UTG and tone generator
    (limited) on local phone
FIX CRAM buffer check. Description: If the CRAM buffer sizes for format1
    do not match the download is still done, which leads to inconsistent
    mailbox state
FIX Bug Fix for PCM advanced connection -> special handling for PCM module
    to Signaling

NEW IFXPHONE_HIGH_LEVEL added to support output signals with level higher
    than 3.14 dBm
NEW Implemented RFC 2833 firmware feature with ETU (event transmission unit).
    The driver now reports events that are played out masked be eventDetect bit
    in the exception bit structure. Event transmission of ATD and UTD features
    is also supported
NEW Interface to enable/change LEC settings for PCM interface
    (IFXPHONE_LECCONF_PCM/IFXPHONE_GETLECCONF_PCM). This feature includes
    setting of the correct default coefficients.
CHG The meaning of nGainRx and nGainTx in TAPI_PHONE_VOLUME changes.
    Instead of having 4 predefined values (OFF, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH), now
    gain range -24 dB up to +24 dB is supported writing directly the dB value.
    A value of -255 indicates OFF.

version 1.0.3.0, 2005-04-14
----------------------------
CHG The warning about SYNC_FAIL reason of hardware interrupt is not shown in
    DS_BASIC_INIT state, since this interrupt reason after reset it is a chip
    errata.

CHG Cleanup dependencies between compiler switches, allows better reduction
    of driver features (e.g. PCM only for VIN 4S)
NEW Support of VINETIC 4S V2.2
DEL Removed option DC Calibration from VINETIC Init message,
    to have a clean split between chip and channel error domains.
    The DC calibration belongs to the channel error domain while VINETIC
    Init belongs to the chip error domain.
    Applications should use the separate Offset Calibration ioctl to calibrate
    channels after chip initialisation.

version 0.10.3, 2004-12-07
--------------------------
FIX TAPI_Phone_GetStatus

KNOWN PROBLEMS
   - GR909 :
   * Blocking waits are used because of the required time accuracy for settling
     time and sampling. For a multichannel service with voice ongoing, this is
     killing because the packets will not be dropped in time. Also the use of a
     non blocking wait (with sheduler) doesn't garantee that time requirements
     will be meet and introduces measurement inacurracy. This implies a concept
     change for GR909 feature in the future (i.e  Gr909 in Chip and not on
     embedded software side).
   * A concept to recognise if a foreign voltage is pending before doing the
     measurement is required, as the ground key recognition isn't reliable.
     In fact, they are situations where Vinetic doesn't send the ground key event
     although an external (foreign) voltage is pending.

version 0.10.2, 2004-12-03
--------------------------
NEW All GR909 Measurements succesfully evaluated on Vinetic 1.4.
    Time requirement of 2 sec and measurements accuracy of 10% are met.
    Timing:
    - Foreign Voltage (Hazardeous & FEMF)    : 350 ms
    - Resistive Fault                        : 825 ms
    - Receiver Offhook                       : 240 ms
    - Ringer Load                            : 210 ms
    Total: 1625 ms out of 2000 ms (= 2 sec)
NEW CID Type 2 implemented (USA spec TIA/EIA-777).
FIX Implementation for packet read for 8 bit Intel interface corrected
FIX Exception mask was not evaluated in IFXPHONE_STATUS. If digits occured the
    fifo was always read. Now the reading of the fifo can be masked and digits
    can be queried with PHONE_GET_DTMF or PHONE_GET_PULSE.
FIX Pulse digit was not set to any value if fifo is empty. Now it returns -1
    if no digits are in.
FIX Event transmission bug in correlation with DTMF CID fixed.
FIX GR909 Receiver Offhook Resistive Faults tests were inaccurate because of
    missing coefficient table for IK (constant current) for Vinetic 1.4.
FIX GR909 AC Voltage measurements were innacurate because level meter results
    sampling was done without 1 ms time intervall.
CHG GR909 Receiver Offhook measurements are done for 15 mA and 30 mA IK
CHG During GR909 AC voltage measurements, samples are (right) shifted by 2 to
    avoid 32-bit overflow during samples addition. In the final formula, this
    shift is taken in count to remove the shift : left shift by 2. Doing so
    makes it possible to measure voltages until 220 Vrms with the specified
    precision (10 %).
CHG Ground Key Recognition is the trigger of GR909 voltage measurements. Because
    it is possible that no ground key is issued by vinetic although an external
    voltage is pending, the ground key flag is stored after first recognition
    and reseted only after a successfull measurement.

     1004 Hz, lm_filter coefficients for all other frequencies have to be
     replaced when provided...
   - VINETIC 1.4: On fast CPUs the board specific WAIT_FOR_READY_FLAG macro has
     to be adapted to wait t_srd = 125ns before the ready bit is polled after
     each command. See VINETIC-4VIP Prel. Data Sheet DS1, Page 42ff.
   - Vinetic 2.1: Linetesting measurements do not work in Power Down Resistive
     Mode and Sleep Power Down Resistive Mode. A workaround is available, but
     not yet implemented.

--------------------------
NEW  LT 2.1 configurable integration time for (battery-)voltage, current and
     resistance measurement
NEW  LT 2.1 resistance RC measurement
NEW  CRAM format 2.2 (adds configuration for TSTR2 register)
     Moved setting of CRAM download related registers (BCR1,2, TSTR2)
     to driver level.
     Note: The ioctl distinguishes now between the CRAM download format
     version VINETIC_IO_CRAM_FORMAT_2_1 and VINETIC_IO_CRAM_FORMAT_2_2;
     VINETIC_IO_CRAM_FORMAT_2 was removed.
NEW  Packets interrupts are masked when the driver is configured for polling
CHG  Payload assignment in that way, that PT for SID is 13 for G711
     and G726. For other codecs its the same PT for the SID as for coder data
     (CR200007149)
FIX  LT universal "AC level" measurement does not change the lm_filter type
     setting to enable filter characteristics measurements
FIX  mailbox could become corrupted when a packet overflow occured
FIX  offset calibration for Vin2.1 was left with DC_SLIC + LM_PREGAIN OFR value
     (bug introduced in internal version 0.9.14.2)
FIX  AAL firmware coder channel configuration was wrong
FIX  default AAL profile was configured to decode G.711 A-Law while the coder
     used u-Law. Now the decoder uses u-Law as well.
FIX  decoding of channel number for downstream packets in polling mode;
     channel numbers 16++ were not decoded correctly
FIX  Linux hangs in CmdRead (introduced in internal version 0.9.14.2)
FIX  bug fix in tapi init: in case DS_DEV_INIT is not set, initialization
     ignores this state and continues, what can lead to a software error
     if the firmware wasn't yet downloaded.
FIX  added overflow protection for packet inbox (i.e. free mailbox space is
     checked before data is written) [patched 2004-10-20]

KNOWN PROBLEMS
   - The lm_filter overflows for large levels. This will be fixed with a later
     ARC patch. Until this patch becomes available, the lm_filter is disabled
     for the gaintracking and SNR signal measurement.
   - The current lm_filter coefficients cannot be used for Notch filters which
     are required for SNR measurements. Until proper lm_filter coefficients
     are available, the SNR measurement will not show correct results.
   - Battery voltage measurements are not implemented for VMB3324.
   - VINETIC 1.4: On fast CPUs the board specific WAIT_FOR_READY_FLAG macro has
     to be adapted to wait t_srd = 125ns before the ready bit is polled after

- Fixed noise during voltage measurements for Vinetic V1.4
- Implemented SID Payload always 13 when assigning coder payload types
- Bug fix: receivers SSRC not returned, was acutually located in
  ssrc and not in rssrc
- Implemented payload type assignment for coder G729E
- Gr909 implementation adapted to support VxWorks
- fixed Vinetic 1.4 capacitance measurement
- Tapi Volume partially implemented : features TX/RX low-medium-high-mute
  implemented, features only rx-muted or only tx_muted not implemented

version 0.9.12, 2004-08-06
-------------------------
- VxWorks: ioctl mutex semaphore removed
- Signal detection implemented and module tested
- CID Receiver feature working whith Fw version 2062.20 RTP
- TAPI Init does NOT set the line to active high! It must be done with PHONE_SET_LINE
- Tapi Cid Sending bug fix: In case of Odd number of CID data,
  last byte wasn't copied in cid buffer
- Added phone volume with supported values 1 .. 3. Not yet tested
- If chip version is higher, the version is set to last known
  version assuming the next chip is compatible with V2.1
- TAPI DTMF_OOB: added option for only in band. Not yet tested
- set LM-SEL to DC current on IT on VINETIC_Init
- fixed problem with AAL profile, 2 ranges was not working
- error handling for default firmware for V2.1 improved. Build
  in firmware now returns error, cause it matches for VIP V.14
- ignore interrupt bits 0x30 for Vinetic V2.1
- Implementation of OTEMP and device reset exception
- NLP added for LEC configuration
- TAPI_VERSION_CHECK added

version 0.9.10, 2004-07-06
-------------------------
- Arc Patch V1.3 included for VINETIC 4M
- Added Vin 2.1 Capacitance Measurement and Offset Calibration
- CRAM download for 4M implemented and tested
- Auto Download command always done in case of V2.1

version 0.9.3, 2004-06-22
-------------------------
- Ifxphone_Data_Add/Remove for coder fully implemented
- Ifxphone_Phone_Add/Remove implemented
- Changed TAPI event handling on file descriptor 0. Old style with Linux exception file
  descriptors available with compiler switch EXCHFD_SUPPORT
- Implemented IFXPHONE_PHONE_STATUS
- Get Capabilites changed to new interface spec
- PHONE_RING_START with CID: CLI or absence of CLI are mandatory for CID.
  If flag isn't set, error will be returned and CID will not be sent.
- Hook state machine times modified. Flash hook is now detected
- AC Voltage with DC Levelmeter and DC Resistance Measurement fixed
- Switch firmware payload to little endian in case of little endian architecture
- Firmware download adapted for Vinetic V.21
- internal write interface modified, that the buffer is offset for the two command words.
  Enables no copy for VxWorks
