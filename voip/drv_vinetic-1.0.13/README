The autogen tool is verified with the MPC (Embedix), AMAZON, AM5120. Montavista
is not yet verified.

1. HOW TO COMPILE

1.1 VxWorks / GNU
Pls. use the Tornado project drv_vinetic.wpj

1.2 VxWorks / GreenHills
currently not supported

1.3 Linux
Execute the following commands. If you have to regenerate the automake files pls
use the autogen.sh instead of configure script .

./configure --build=i686-pc-linux --host=powerpc-linux --enable-warnings --enable-kernelincl=/export/easy334_linux/include --enable-lt --enable-v1 --enable-v2 --enable-trace --enable-incl-bin
ucClibc:
./configure --build=i686-pc-linux --host=powerpc-linux-uclibc --enable-warnings --enable-kernelincl=~/projects/uclibc/buildroot/build_powerpc/linux-2.4.26-erik/include --enable-lt --enable-v1 --enable-v2 --enable-trace --enable-incl-bin --prefix=/exports/${USER}_ppc/opt/ifx

To modify compiler switches change the environment variable CFLAGS. For example: CFLAGS=-DDEFAULT_LM_NORMAL

make

1.3.2 Example for AM5120 board
export CC=/export/tools/bin/mipsel-linux-gcc
./configure --build=i686-pc-linux --host=mipsel-linux --enable-warnings --enable-kernelincl=/export/ADM5120/linux-2.4.20-MVS/include --enable-trace --enable-incl-bin --disable-v2 --enable-8bit

1.3.3 Example for AMAZON board
export CC=/root/uclibc-tool/toolchain/gcc-3.3.x/toolchain_mips/bin/mips-linux-gcc
./configure --build=i686-pc-linux --host=mips-linux --enable-warnings --enable-kernelincl=$HOME/projects/amazon/source/kernel/opensource/linux_2_4_20_mvl/include --enable-boardname=AMAZON --enable-spi --enable-trace --enable-incl-bin

1.3.4 Adding compiler flags
export CFLAGS="-DDEBUG"


2. HOW TO GET DOCUMENTATION
change to ./doc directory and execute

doxygen doxyconfig

3. USER ADAPTATIONS

For user specific adaptations (macros for instance), a file named 
drv_config_user.default.h is provided with blank macros. 

This file must be copied into the target build directory and renamed into 
drv_config_user.h.

After doing so, compiling with extra flag "ENABLE_USER_CONFIG" (set with option
--enable-user-config if using automake) enables the driver to use user specific
settings.
