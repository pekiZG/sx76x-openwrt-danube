1. HOW TO COMPILE
-----------------

1.1 VxWorks / GNU

Pls. use the Tornado project drv_vinboard.wpj (located in top directory)

1.2 Linux

Execute following commands after filling the missing infomations

a) ./configure --build=i686-pc-linux --host=powerpc-linux --enable-warnings --enable-trace
   - if you must specify your linux kernel includes, 
     add option "--enable-kernelincl=<your kernel include>"
     (default is /home/${user}/linux/include)
   - in case you work with devfs, your kernel supports this and sets the 
     appropriate flg for you. You don't need to set the compiler switch yourself
  
b) make
c) make install

Note: 
- If you have to regenerate the automake files pls use the autogen.sh instead of configure script .
- To modify compiler switches, change the environment variable CFLAGS (i.e CFLAGS="-D<your flag>")
- You can execute the configure script within a build directory if you want to keep objects files
  and source files separated.

2. HOW TO GET DOCUMENTATION
---------------------------

change to ./doc directory and execute

doxygen doxyconfig

3. ABOUT DEVICES 
----------------

3.1 VxWorks

device name : /dev/vinboard/0  
Note        : the device will be created by the driver at installation

3.2 Linux (No devfs)

device name  : /dev/vinboard/0 
Device Major : given at insmod: "insmod major_number=<your major number>"
Device Minor : 0
Note         : On your target (MPC)
               a) create directory vinboard   : 
                  mkdir /dev/vinboard
               b) create node "0" in directory :
                  cd /dev/vinboard
                  mknod 0 c major_number 0
3.3 Linux (devfs)

device name  : /dev/vinboard/0 
Device Major : given at insmod: "insmod major_number=<your major number>"
Note         : Device will be created at insmod.

4. (Quick) Tests 
----------------

4.1 VxWorks

1- use the test project file under drv_vinboard/tests and generate an a.out file
2- download the out file and invoke functions from the VxWorks shell

Note: You must call the function providing the file descriptors as first.

4.2 Linux
---------

1- build Linux binary "make -f Makefile.linux install"
2- On your target shell, enter "./bt" in your binary directory for help
3- Process your tests according to help options
